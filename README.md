# Data Strategy

Data Strategy

Also the Strategy can be 
- Centralized Data Strategy
- De Centralized Data Strategy

Centralized data is very good for Business inteligence, Analytics, AI and ML. Centralized Startegy are hard to be real time but has the advantage of integrating various other business systems data collected in central location. Even systen that can batch load on a scheduled interval varying from hour to days to weeks. Provides ability to combine different systems data into one and has the ability to view data across enterprise footprint.

De centralized data is needed for business operational analytics to take decision on real time basis. They are siloed to business function and provides real time analytics for advanced analytics, AI and ML use cases and also operational reporting needs. Mostly realtime. Operational data stores the business process and it not aggregated.

For enterprise to run their business as usual both has to be present.

Data movement can be reduced by centralized data.


1) Business Strategy for data

A good data strategy shouldn’t be created in isolation; it must be driven by your overall business strategy. Therefore, the first step in any data strategy is to consider your organization's strategic priorities and key business questions. Only then can you identify how you might use data to help you deliver those priorities and answer your business questions.

The data uses and priorities that you identify in this phase are your use cases. To ensure your data strategy is focused and achievable, I’d stick to no more than 3–5 data use cases.

2) Short-term adoption priorities

Also known as quick wins! Because the big strategic data priorities can take some time to implement and deliver value, I find it's helpful to also identify 1–3 data quick wins. These are fast, ideally relatively inexpensive ways for you to add value and demonstrate return on investment from data – which, in turn, helps you gain buy-in for those more prominent data use cases. For example, you might do some customer churn analysis, to help prevent or reduce customer turnover.

Next, for each of the data priorities/use cases that you’ve identified, you need to work through the following considerations:

3) Data requirements

In this stage, think about what data you need to achieve your goals and where that data will come from. This includes:

- Do you need structured or unstructured data, or (ideally) a combination of the two?
- Can you achieve your goal with internal data alone, or do you need to supplement your company data with external data (for example, social media data, weather data, etc.)?
- Do you already have or can you quickly access the data you need?
- If not, you need to set up a way to collect the appropriate data. What data collection method will you use?

4) Data Governance

Data brings great rewards, but it can also be a serious liability if you don’t pay proper attention to data governance. This step encourages you to think about data quality, data security, privacy and ownership issues, transparency and ethical data use. Key considerations include:

- Who is responsible for ensuring the data is accurate, complete and up to date?
- How will ensure the data is stored securely?
- If you’re accessing someone else’s data, could you lose access to it? What will you do if they cut you off?
- How do you ensure the ethical use of data?
- What permissions do you need to be able to gather and use the data?
- How can you minimize data where possible (a fundamental principle of GDPR)?
- How will you ensure the open and honest use of data across the business?

5) Data Lineage

Data is generated in lots of other system and we need to make sure end to end data moving through different systems. Each system will have their own lineage. 

- Where did the data originator?
- What systems were used to transfer and transform?
- Who is the owner?
- Who is the management for the data?
- who are target systems using the data?
- What do they use the data for?
- Impact Analysis for upstream and downstream and how?
- Risk analysis of data across the lineage?

6) Ethical, Legal, Privacy

Data can be in any form and have to follow regulation in global scale which has to considered for ethical, legal and other privacy concern validation

- How to monitor the data for ethical issues?
- how is data security practices, protect individual privacy, maintain promised confidentiality, and ensure appropriate access and use?
- How is transparency across the data life cycle managed?
- How to apply policy and enforce them?

7) Technology Implementation

Having decided how you want to use data, and what data you’ll need, the next step is to identify the technology and infrastructure implications of those decisions. In very simple terms, this means looking at your hardware and software needs for:

- Collecting data
- Storing and organizing data
- Processing (analyzing) data to extract insights, which may include machine learning or deep learning technology
- Communicating insights from data, including reporting and data visualization

8) Skills Needed and capacity

Often, the main stumbling block for companies wanting to get more out of data is the lack of data skills and knowledge. Therefore, this is a critical part of your data strategy. Ask yourself:

- Do you have the skills to deliver your data needs?
- If not, can you train in-house staff or do you need to hire new talent?
- If you’re looking at external skills, will you partner with a data provider or is there potential to acquire a company?
- Leadership awareness is another important part of this. Your leadership team needs to understand why data is important and how data can help the business achieve its objectives. Ideally, this culture of data will filter throughout the whole company, so that everyone at every level is aware of the power of data.

9) Implentations and change management 

Making a plan is one thing; delivering it is another. So this last step is about making sure your data strategy becomes reality. This includes:

- How will you implement your plan? What are the key activities that need to happen next?
- Who is responsible for delivering each action?
- What changes does the business need to make?

10) KPI measurement

Ability to measure KPI to govern the above data strategy.

11) Data Locality

Given global companies need data to be stored in specific countries for their requirement. This pose the most difficulty as, data is stored in distributed countries with boundries and their own law and process. Also data processing has to be done locally to obey the law's of countries.  Data Governance tools should provide country specific in some case state specific lineage and tracking for personal and other important data points.

- How do we find data locality requirements
- Who is going to be responsible for delivering action/
- How is this going to be implemented?
- How will the change management work?
- What is the operating model
- How do we track and audit based on data processed.
- How to work with government to understand their requirements
- How to help government to validate the process

12) Data Soverignity 

Data laws are based on country specific for PII data and ability to see the lineage. This section is very challenging as privacy, compliance and legal are all involved in this process. Given the global world we live in, respecting country specific laws are very crucial like GDPR, CCPA and others. Ability to audit the lineage and show how the data is going to be used is very crucial. A system that can provide country specific law and it's usage compliance is becoming more prevalent than ever. Data processing systems should be able to report country specific transformation and what they are doing is another key area. 

- How to work with government to define lawa
- How is reponsible for creating the law?
- Who is responsible for deliverying actions?
- How to handle multi department like privacy, security, complaince and governance RACI model
- How to report breach or non compliance
- Operating model
- Corproate Awareness for the data privacy
- Systems to handle the above
